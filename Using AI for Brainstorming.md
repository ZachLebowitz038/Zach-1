# AI Generated List
(Note: I have added formatting manually in markdown to match the formatting the AI response used in Gemini's own UI. That is, the use of headers and bolded text with bullet points).


That's a great request! Here's a list of possible essay topics related to **technical or professional writing,** categorized for different angles:


## Theoretical & Foundational Topics
* **The Ethics of Accessibility:** Explore the moral and professional responsibility of technical writers to ensure documentation is accessible to all users, including those with disabilities.
* **Defining "Technical":** Analyze the differences and overlaps between "technical writing" and "professional writing," arguing for a unified or distinct approach in modern business.
* **The Rhetoric of Documentation:** Discuss how rhetorical principles (audience, purpose, context) are applied in creating effective technical documents like user manuals or API references.
* **Clarity vs. Comprehensiveness:** Argue for the optimal balance a technical writer must strike between achieving absolute clarity and providing exhaustive, comprehensive detail in complex documentation.

## Tools, Technology, & Trends
* **The Impact of Generative AI:** Investigate the current and future role of tools like ChatGPT in automating, assisting, or transforming the technical writing process, including ethical considerations.
* **Docs-as-Code (DaC):** Analyze the shift towards "Docs-as-Code" methodologies (using tools like Git, Markdown, and static site generators) and its implications for the technical writing skillset.
* **The Rise of Minimalism:** Evaluate the effectiveness of **Minimalism** (focused, task-oriented writing) in technical documentation, contrasting it with traditional verbose methods.
* **Video vs. Text:** Compare the efficacy of video tutorials versus traditional text-based documentation for teaching complex technical tasks, arguing for the optimal mix.

## Practical & Professional Applications
* **The Business Case for Good Documentation:** Argue why high-quality professional and technical documentation is a critical component of customer success, product adoption, and a company's bottom line.
* **Audience Analysis in Specialized Fields:** Choose a specific industry (e.g., aerospace, pharmaceuticals, finance) and discuss the unique challenges in analyzing and addressing its highly specialized audience.
* **The Art of the Persuasive Proposal:** Deconstruct the structure and rhetorical strategies used in professional writing to craft a compelling business or grant proposal.
* **Simplifying Complexity:** Detail the specific techniques (e.g., analogies, visual aids, chunking) technical writers employ to translate highly complex engineering or scientific concepts into actionable instructions for a lay audience.

## Design & Usability
* **Information Design:** Examine the role of visual and information design (layout, typography, use of white space) in improving the usability and readability of technical documents.
* **Integrating Text and Visuals:** Discuss the principles for effectively combining text and graphics (screenshots, diagrams, charts) to enhance user understanding in instructions or reports.
* **Usability Testing for Docs:** Argue for the importance of **usability testing** documentation and outline a practical methodology for doing so.
* **The Structure of Digital Help:** Analyze the challenges and best practices for structuring information in non-linear formats, such as online help systems, knowledge bases, and single-source content.

# Commentary (not AI generated)

I think the topics are solid, at least as somebody less familiar with technical writing. The categories including general concepts in the technical writing process, industry trends, how technical writing could be favorable in business and technical writing accessibility made for some reasonably tangible starting points to base essay sub-categories on. Some of the sub-categories would be a bit more helpful if they were less general however. Ideas like “Compare usefulness of video tutorials vs text-based documentation” I feel, while plausible to write a paper on, would not really make for a very long essay, and the note that one should is “argue for the optimal mix” seems somewhat meaningless since I feel like it can be pretty subjective what tasks are better suited for visual vs textual instructions. 


Though I do appreciate the more specific instructions on what a paper could look like in some of the examples, such as the suggestion of selecting a specific industry then breaking down the challenges of writing for its particular audience. One of the primary categories suggesting “Foundational concepts” felt kind of redundant since secondary topics like accessibility are already listed, with their own sub-categories, later on. This section also offered the broadest categories that I don't think could really make for a lengthy discussion, such as the definitions of technical writing and professional writing themselves.


I found interesting the section that mentioned upcoming trends, and how the AI generated reflection suggested writing a paper on the use of ChatGPT itself, but I also think that I wouldn’t necessarily consider the idea of using “Video vs Text” as a “trend” in technical communication fields. I did appreciate how Gemeni broke down the list into sections with their own sub-categories on an organizational level overall. Previous times I have asked an LLM for a list back when it first came out, and it mainly just gave me a few bullet points rather than incorporating segmented formatting, and this definitely made it easier to read and look through. 


Overall, this was a decent list created by the AI in response to my prompt asking for technical and professional writing essay ideas. Some ideas were definitely too broad to be particularly helpful, while others have some potential to make for a decent discussion on a particular topic in technical writing. Where I would go next with this is to ask the AI to further elaborate the broader essay ideas, and give some more concrete examples on what they would look like as papers. Though I personally think I could come up with things to write about even with the broader topics with my own ingenuity or research. into some more specific aspects of topics like “simplifying complex ideas.” For example, for the "simplifying complex ideas" concept I could maybe discuss how one would break down concepts to different sub-groups in audiences, how to recognize who your writings may be for, what types of vocabulary to use or even go into historical examples of how inaccessible, or unclear, use of language had been used to prevent certain communities from accessing services like voting in the United States. While I do think AI could suggest to format an essay in a similar structure, I  value the ingenuity of knowing how to expand giving topics from one’s own understanding of what an audience could need. Although this is a brainstorming tool that could certainly help those having a hard time coming up with ideas in a short timeframe.

<h1>3 First Impressions of HTML</h1>
 
  <h3> Block and Inline Elements</h3>
    <p>
I learned about the various elements one can create within an HTML file, whether it be different types of headings, paragraphs or elements which 
<em> italicize</em> text. I also learned about the "&lt;img&gt;" tag which is used in conjunction with an ancillary folder to display images.
 
I also learned about the system of formatting separate lines as blocks versus inline elements such as "span" so I can change attributes of given 
<span style="background-color: chartreuse;"> parts</span> of a single line.

All elements always must begin and end with their indicator titles surrounded by angle brackets. The second set of brackets to contain the line
 must have a "/" before the title of the element. And unlike markdown, one must indicate the next line by creating a new dividing block/paragraph, 
 rather than simply adding a new line by pressing "enter" within the code.

      <h3> Visual Studio Code Basics</h3>
    <p>
I installed and learned how to use Visual Studio Code as an interface for creating scripts. I found helpful its assistive code completion feature of 
"intellisense," which seems to make the coding session more convenient than if I were to just use GitHub's interface. I learned how to manually create 
.html files, and save my edits within the program to see my updates when I refresh my html page. I also found useful the warnings that they issue when 
one may make a mistake in their code, as well as the ability to make a workspace with set files on the side bar one can switch between. It somewhat 
reminds me of Adobe Lightroom's ability to quickly switch between folders. (Although Lightroom and Visual Studio Code serve entirely different purposes.)
I also learned from the first tutorial about the plug-ins offered in the programs. Those which enable assistance with more coding languages, or automatically 
show previews of your files, were quite useful extensions for one's workflow in this program.

      <h3> Additional HTML setup</h3>
    <p>

From the beginning tutorial offered by the HTML overview reading, there were a few ways I found were recommended to set up an HTML coding file to 
make sure some things functioned properly. For example there was the starting instance of "&lt;!doctype html&gt;" to ensure the usage of what is considered 
the recommended standard for the way one's file will function. There was also the "&lt;meta charset="utf-8"&gt;" which would enable the use of a wide selection 
of characters throughout many languages one may need to use in their document. For writing special characters though, I learned that I could use entities, 
starting with an ampersand and ending with a semicolon, to bypass the usage of characters that typically serve a practical function in HTML, or display 
characters that are simply difficult to type with an average keyboard.

          <h4> Conclusion</h4>
    <p>
Overall, I learned the basics of creating HTML documents using base elements with their tags, usage of block and inline elements, the basics of Visual Studio 
Code, and some special cases to prevent more complex issue down the line.

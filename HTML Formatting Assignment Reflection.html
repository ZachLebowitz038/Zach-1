<h1>Reflection</h1> 

<p>
In a Web Design class, there was an assignment where students had to attend a seminar then reflect on what they learned. I felt as though using this assignment for the exercise would work well since my original format would allow me to practice breaking things down into lists and sections. I was slightly confused adding the image at first, since I thought I had to put the specific path before "Finn.png," but I then found that if the image was included in the file I did not have to specify the path. I also cleaned up some of the writing and organized sections with additional headers which were not present in the original assignment. Some step-by-step instructions I included as numbered lists and others I included as an unordered list with "Step X" beforehand. In a technical writing setting, I would have a specific reason for displaying a numbered list vs non-ordered (for example if instructions actually need to be in order versus just listing items without a sequence), but for this assignment I simply wanted to try both styles to show a breadth of elements in HTML. The original link I included in the assignment actually linked to the speaker's website, but since I found the domain was no longer in service, I instead linked to another seminar of her's, simply to show that I could provide a working link in HTML. The assignment also included a name and date, so I felt I could include that just to be comprehensive, even if I would not usually include information like this on a content article of some sort.

Overall, I appreciated practicing HTML with this exercise, and was glad I could apply it to this assignment which is more instructional and informational in nature, reflecting on a mental health resource for managing one's time.

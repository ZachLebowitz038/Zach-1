# 3 Key Takeaways About Markdown

This week we learned about how to further format instructions or content with Markdown
documents, here are 3 most interesting things I have learned about Markdown structure.

## Structuring lists

I have learned how to structure a list in both sequential and nonconsecutive order:

1. I learned I could begin by simply typing out "1." to begin formatting my list 
2. I found that Markdown automatically formats the followin.g and previous, numbers in a sequence by simply pressing "enter" between entries
3. Non-sequential lists use either a "*" or a "-" instead of any particular number.

An example of a non-sequential list may look like this:

Ingredients in a BLT:

* Bacon
* Tomato
* Lettuce
* Mayo

This is useful to me incase I ever want to use Markdown to compile a library of information
that contains sub-catagories more easily readable in a list format. This is also useful for if
I ever want to compose some instructions hosted using a service that requires Markdown in a readable
format.

## Code Samples

As somebody who does not intend on using back-end code for my career, I think it will be useful to 
understand how Markdown can help me communicate with coders for technical projects. So I appreciated
learning how to format code samples so my documentation could use some base examples of where things
go, or just what types of code to include in general. I have also found that it makes it much more
convenient for readers who are trying to navigate more complex instructions to install a program
offered via GitHub, which requires entering specific lines of code into one's command prompt to get
an element within a program to function properly.

For example I can insert code contained within three backticks "```"

```
print("Hello, world")
```

I  also think I would prefer to section code examples using the fence method rather than using four 
spaces, since it seperates content in a much more visible way in the editing UI, so I can clearly see
where the code begins and ends. I also do remember from some coding classes that it can be important to
put a certain number of spaces before particular lines, so I understand that using the four spaces method
could get confusing pretty quick, when there's just that one extra set of spaces to keep track of.

### Conclusion

Overall, this is a bit more familiar to me than I thought, and I'm glad I 
have at least a beginner's understanding of these concepts already. GitHub has 
always been a familiar and useful resource to me when trying to find advanced,
open-source programs that are made free to a community, so I think it is useful
that I can learn a bit more of how it operates and functions for creators and coders.

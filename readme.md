# Week 1 First Impressions

My first impressions of this week, were mainly the basics of navigating GitHub 
as a creator, as opposed to a user, and how to actually begin creating Markdown
formatted texts. These three topics are what I feel like I began to understood
through this first week:

## GitHub Navigation

I have downloaded programs from GitHub before, using a fork to get an 
application's .exe and ancillary documentation, but have never navigated
the UI of making my own GitHub project previously. The Introduction to 
GitHub article on Canvas was quite helpful, despite how simple it might
be to a more experienced coder. I honestly could not find the **"Add file"**
button at first, before realizing I had to make a new repository.

## Learning Markdown

This week, we learned about using Markdown and formatting different types of
text in ways such as *italics* and **bold**. I also learned to navigate the
GitHub UI to properly be able to preview my work, since I realized I needed
to add a *.md* extension to my filename in order to enable Markdown. Learning 
to make heads, subheads or sub-subheads, reminded me of using the raw code
format to edit Wikipedia articles, rather than using their more user-friendly 
content management system. Again, I am not a life-long coder like others, but
I've found myself feeling much more in control when using a site's Markup
language directly. For more complex manuevers like making tables, I typically
look at code from other articles and use them as templates so I understand how
to apply my information within a required system.

## Professional uses of Docs as Code

I read through the articles and some of the optional reading to learn about how
these types of workflow tools are used by professionals. I learned how GitHub 
can help larger teams of coders see if anyone made a change, and collaborate on
large-scale projects by clearly communicating what is being worked on and why.
Writing documentation as one makes updates to code does seem like a more 
convenient way of working overall to help your fellow coders, technical writers
and users understand progress being made directly and efficiently. I personally
may not use GitHub in my work as a Journalism major, but it is interesting to see
how this can be used for personal projects, as well as give me some insight into
how I could potentially make things more convenient for a technical writer that
I'd work in proximity to later on.

### Conclusion

Overall, this is a bit more familiar to me than I thought, and I'm glad I 
have at least a beginner's understanding of these concepts already. GitHub has 
always been a familiar and useful resource to me when trying to find advanced,
open-source programs that are made free to a community, so I think it is useful
that I can learn a bit more of how it operates and functions for creators and coders.
